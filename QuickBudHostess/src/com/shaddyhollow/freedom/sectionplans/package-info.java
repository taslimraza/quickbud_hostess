 *	These are section plans.  There can be 1 to many sectionplans for each location, and a sectionplan
 *	spans multiple floorplans.
 *
 *	A sectionplan is a list of sections and their table assignments.  Table positions are not relevant,
 *	neither are servers, table sizes, or anything else.  Just sections (including color and name) and 
 *	their table lists (and we really only care about the ids).
